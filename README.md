Infusing my Passion for Space and Astronomy, my Excel project provides a meticulously curated report that unveils the captivating narrative of space missions spanning the years 1957 to 2022. This project has been built using an expansive dataset, meticulously encompassing the entire spectrum of space missions, a foundational cornerstone that allows for insightful exploration.

### **Business Problem:**<br>
1. How have rocket launches trended across time? Has the mission success rate increased?
2. Which countries have had the most successful space missions? Has it always been that way?
3. Which rocket has been used for most space missions? Is it still active?
4. Are there any patterns you can notice with the launch locations?



### **What Was Done:**<br>
Starting with the finer details of cleaning data, the report takes shape, making things clear and precise. I've skillfully picked out important info, creating special columns like "country" from tricky locations column and smoothly putting together month and year details from complex dates. As I've dived into the data, my focus has shifted toward analysis. Using Excel's smart analysis tools, I've uncovered trends, achievements, and cool insights that were hidden in the data. Calculations help us see the mission details better. By blending numbers and stories, I've created visual magic. My report turns data into eye-catching graphs, revealing patterns and big moments. This visual show helps us understand things deeply, going beyond just numbers.




### **Key Insights:**<br>
The report pays great attention to details and shares a bunch of important info. Here are some main points to take away: Successful missions have increased each year, hitting a high of 143 in 2021. The top three countries with the most missions are Russia, the USA, and Kazakhstan. The Cosmos-3M rocket holds a record for the most launches â€“ a whopping 370 times before retiring in 2010. When it comes to spending, NASA takes the lead, investing a whopping $76 billion in space missions.
